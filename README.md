official of javascript says   a) official name of js is ECMA script. b) js has two types of objects 1) internal 2) external  external -need basis (var )  there two approc to write the code in Enterprise- 1) traditional 2) object oriented  4) there 8 versions available of js in the market  1.1 1.2 . . 1.5 - ES5 1.6 - ES6 . 1.8   5) nowadays, we are writing next generation JS for UI development so that  we are using two transformaers or compilers for the UI development  a) babel (use it with react) b) typescript (angular)   1) VS Code 2) Node min 3.11 .. max --8.11 3) open internet connection 4) Chrome   Node js : - V8 + Http Server + NPM (NPMjs.com)  npm install -g npm   Note - In market only three based in ES6  1) Angular (2x start 6x) (MVC) 2) React (.d16(ES5) n .v16(ES6)) (View) 3) ESTJS (6x)  ES6 Concepts -   ES6 -> Basic Es6 + Advance ES6  Basic ES6-  1) Class &amp; Object - done 2) Property &amp; Methods  define the properties &amp; method in ES6  there are three type of properties/method in ES6  1)public prop/method  - this 2) private prop/method - "_" with no support in browser (public ) 3) previlledged prop/method - no keyword (itself a public method to expose the private stuff outside the class)  3) prototype 1) reserved keyword in JS which are using to create the extension of the class 2) prototype impl based open close implementation 3) default ext of prototype is public  4) static a) ES6 impl there is new kyword used fot static method and properties.  5) abstraction 6) encapsulation 7) inheritance  a) extend keyword to achieve the inheritance b) in ES6 we can only achieve single level inheritance  Polymorphism -  in jS overloading is not possible but we can override  8) Namespace a)it is global object which is using to get exposed the complete JS library. b) let myapplication ={}; for e.g. for Jquery we have $.  Advance ES6 -  1) Let vs var/Const a) Let is more powerful than var because we can set the scoping of let at function level, block level etc.  2) Arrow function a) arrow function is representing by the arrow keyword. b) are normal function but represeting in the form of expression. c) arrow function syntx exeute fast as compare to the annonymous function creation  3) Spread operatoor/ REST operator  a) it is represeting by the "..." b) spread is always be coverting number of parameters into array object.   4) Destructuring  a)    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Protype :-  Classname.prototype.property = 100 classname.prototype.methodname = function(){ //Implementation  }   +++++++++++++++ a) react is a library which is designed for view b) react is providing two implict object a) props (stateless object) b) state (stateful) c) we can create the react components in two ways  1) var MyComponent = react.createClass({   //implementation })  2) Class MyComponent extends React.Component{   //component creation }  d) in react js implementation we basically use two library a) react.js (provides core capabilities state and prop management, component life cycle hook management, event binding etc.) b) reactDom.js (virtula DOm of react which is using to get render the react component on physical DOM to the specific placeholder(selector))  a) class  b) id  c) name  d)    e) we will write all the component in jsx format which is trans combiled by the bebal in ES  5 code          +++++++++++++++++++++++++  react compomne    1) creae comp using react.component class  2) contains render function which will return   3) react managing component life cycle
